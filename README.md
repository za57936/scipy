1.​ Introduction This assignment will help you to consolidate the concepts learnt in the session.

2.​ Problem Statement

Scipy: We have the min and max temperatures in a city In India for each months of the year. We would like to find a function to describe this and show it graphically, the dataset given below. Task:

    fitting it to the periodic function
    plot the fit Data Max = 39, 41, 43, 47, 49, 51, 45, 38, 37, 29, 27, 25 Min = 21, 23, 27, 28, 32, 35, 31, 28, 21, 19, 17, 18

Matplotlib: This assignment is for visualization using matplotlib: data to use: url= https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Geoyi/Cleaning-Titanic-Data/master/titanic_original.cs v titanic = pd.read_csv(url) Charts to plot:

    Create a pie chart presenting the male/female proportion
    Create a scatterplot with the Fare paid and the Age, differ the plot color by gender.

I have done both the assignment parts and scrrenshot of the output has been attached.
